$S = \lb\frac{e^{inx}}{\sqrt{2\pi}},\;n=0,\pm1,\pm2\ldots\rb$ 
is a complete set of orthonormal vectors 
(that is, an orthonormal basis) of $L^2[0,2\pi]$.
\eteo

Note that by 
Lemma~\ref{lem7.5} 
this is equivalent to ensuring that if $f \in L^2[0,2\pi]$
then $f_N(x)$ converges (in the norm of $L^2[0,2\pi]$) to $f$ as $N\to\infty$.

\bpru
The orthogonality is trivial and is part of a previous exercise, so we
will only focus on completeness.
